ShareB&B»
As we move towards a world where people share more and more things, it’s time we build an application where users can share outdoor spaces like backyards or pools!

- Users should be able to search for homes and apartments to with an outdoor space to rent
- Authenticated users should be able to post a listing with photos, a price, and details of the private outdoor space
- Authenticated users I should be able to message other users to ask questions about listings and book them
- Photos should be stored in Amazon S3, not in a database
- Users should be able to search for a listing
- As a bonus, include an interface with a map that updates with listings when moved
